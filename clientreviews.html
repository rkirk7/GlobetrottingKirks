        This is the first time I have used a travel advisor, as I am a flight attendant myself and usually plan my own trips. However, I could not recommend Mei Mei enough. She literally responds within minutes or hours, is highly experienced and qualified, and poured her heart into planning a wonderful trip for us, even super last minute. She checked in with us frequently, listened to our needs, and just planned the most beautiful itinerary for us. She is highly organized, structured, and trustworthy. She also adds a personal touch by getting to know her clients and allow us to get to know her as well, exchanging photos with each other and more. She is attentive to detail too - literally nothing went wrong. I would book with Mei Mei a million times over, and highly recommend her to anyone!

        Working with Mei-Mei made the entire experience seamless from start to finish. She anticipated every detail and provided thoughtful recommendations that took our trip to the next level like the CocoCay beach bed and specialty dining packages! Mei-Mei is responsive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about making your vacation perfect. It felt like working with a friend who just happens to be an expert in luxury travel. I can’t wait to plan my next adventure with her!
