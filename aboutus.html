We've hiked New Zealand, Patagonia, Nepal, and many national parks in the U.S.; we've gone on numerous safaris and have had amazing animal experiences in the Galapagos, the Arctic, and Antarctica; we've enjoyed numerous cruises around the world, from luxury to more family-friendly cruise lines; and we've enjoyed exploring beautiful, interesting locations around the world.<p>

      <h2>About Mei-Mei</h2>
      <p>I’m a retired media exec who has been passionately exploring the world for the past decade and helping others find their way. I’ve been to 70-plus countries and all seven continents, having fallen in love with Antarctica in 2024. My favorite place? Africa, where I’ll return for my 7th time in December.</p>
      <p>At 65, my adventurous spirit is stronger than ever. But I like my luxuries, too. My personal expertise, discerning scrutiny, and tireless research produce show-stopping experiences that are unforgettable. I'd love to help make your bucket list dreams come true!</p>

      <h2>About Regan</h2>
      <p>I am an English professor and TaeKwonDo instructor near Orlando, Florida; in my past life, I was a corporate lawyer in New York City. I have a B.A. from the University of Washington in English and economics, a J.D. from Yale University, and an M.F.A. in creative writing from Columbia University. I also design custom iPhone and Android apps and have a professional coding certification from MITxEmeritus.</p>
      <p>I travel often, constantly seeking out beautiful locales and outdoor adventures. (This picture is from the four-day W Trek in Torres Del Paine National Park in Chile.) I am an avid writer, with several novels and one musical in my repertoire, and when I was seven years old I won a national contest to invent and publish a board game. In the past, I've moonlit occasionally as a pianist at a local establishment. Two adorable goldendoodles always keep me on my toes!</p>
