      <h2>About Mei-Mei</h2>
      <div class="card shadow-sm mb-4 p-4">
        <div class="card-body">
          <p>After an all-consuming career as a media executive, I took early retirement in 2015 and have joyfully traveled the world ever since.</p>
      
          <p>I’ve been to 70-plus countries and all seven continents, having fallen in love with Antarctica in 2024. My favorite place? <strong>Africa</strong>, where I’ll return for my 7th time in December of 2025.</p>
      
          <p>Friends frequently sought my travel assistance and I loved helping them. <em>"You should be a travel advisor,"</em> everyone told me. So I did!</p>
      
          <p>Now I'm excited to not only share my insider expertise and enthusiasm with clients, but also make their dreams come true, leveraging <strong>Virtuoso</strong> and <strong>Fora Travel's</strong> extensive industry resources and relationships.</p>
      
          <p>Powered by Fora, my exceptional expertise, scrutiny, creativity, and communication skills produce show-stopping experiences that are unforgettable.</p>
      
          <p>From cruises to safaris, tours of Europe to weekend getaways, I wholeheartedly embrace the research, planning, advocating, minutiae, and bookings. All you have to do is pack!</p>

          <p>At 65-plus, my adventurous spirit is stronger than ever. I love being a globetrotter, usually with my adult daughter and travel advisor partner <strong>Regan Kirk</strong>.</p>
      
          <p>There's so much of the world to discover, and to learn from. Where do you long to go? What captures your imagination?</p>

      <h2>About Regan</h2>
      <p>I am an English professor and TaeKwonDo instructor near Orlando, Florida; in my past life, I was a corporate lawyer in New York City. I have a B.A. from the University of Washington in English and economics, a J.D. from Yale University, and an M.F.A. in creative writing from Columbia University. I also design custom iPhone and Android apps and have a professional coding certification from MITxEmeritus.</p>
      <p>I travel often, constantly seeking out beautiful locales and outdoor adventures. (This picture is from the four-day W Trek in Torres Del Paine National Park in Chile.) I am an avid writer, with several novels and one musical in my repertoire, and when I was seven years old I won a national contest to invent and publish a board game. In the past, I've moonlit occasionally as a pianist at a local establishment. Two adorable goldendoodles always keep me on my toes!</p>
