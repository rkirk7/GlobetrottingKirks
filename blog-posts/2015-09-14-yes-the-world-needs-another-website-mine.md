I have a couple of books on the tips of my fingers. And I have at least seven friends who have said they would buy them. Recipe for success.

My daughter [Regan Kirk](http://regankirk.com), the aspiring writer _with an agent,_ said I need to do a blog and create a following. Since she _has an agent,_ she should know what she's talking about, right?

I started looking up blog options like Wordpress, which is what Regan (_"I have an agent"_) uses, and dipping my toe in the water so to speak. But it seemed odd to me to just start writing out-of-the-blue in a universe that's flooded with one-trick voices and opinions.

What do I have that's different? Substantive content: columns I wrote as President and Publisher of The News-Press, diaries of our travel adventures, terrific photographs. Body of quality work=credibility.

So that led me to create a website: [Mei-Mei's Musings](http://meimeikirk.com). It features insights to amuse and inspire on topics I'm passionate about: leadership, travel, family, media.<!--more-->

I used Wix, which is largely user-friendly, flexible and inexpensive. Which was a little unnerving since my career was built around telling people they needed expert marketers to help them with their digital outreach. (Helpful husband: "Yours doesn't look like the professional websites." Thanks dear.)

There are five sections around my passions:

- Leadership columns, focusing on branding, development and guidance for individual journeys
- Personal tales, focused on my family's journey from rural China to the "Golden Mountain" called America
- Reflections, columns about a variety of topics with life lessons for all
- Travel highlights and photo galleries
- This blog, which will offer fresh content

I  spent hours when I should have been studying bridge with Randy working on this project, finding, editing, designing, packaging, reviewing, adjusting, linking, customizing.  Often it was entertaining as I relived moments in time or researched captions for travel photos.

Now comes the part that's really fun: finding another seven people who are as interested in my musings as I am.

Won't you join my circle? (Not in a whiny nor pleading tone; a friendly invitational tone.)
