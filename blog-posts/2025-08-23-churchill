# Birds, Bears, and Belugas: Our Churchill Adventure
*2025-08-23*

Whew.  

The sleepy little town of Churchill, in the subarctic Hudson Bay, buzzes with tourists from May to November. That's when Arctic birds migrate overhead, beluga whales come to feed, polar bears wander by waiting for the bay to freeze, and the Northern Lights can be spotted.

Stunningly, in late July to late August, you can kayak next to belugas, catch polar bears lazing, and admire the aurora borealis—all in the same day. Which we did!

## Ways to Experience Churchill

There are three primary ways to experience Churchill:  

1. **Churchill Wild wilderness ecolodges**  
2. **Churchill-based excursions** arranged by lodges and tour-only companies  
3. **Cruise ships stopping overnight**, including Silversea, Hapag-Lloyd, and Adventure Life

## Arrival at Churchill Wild

On Aug. 1, 2025, my adult daughter Regan and I arrived in Churchill to start our Birds, Bears, and Belugas experience with Churchill Wild.  

This family-owned company runs three remote, fly-in ecolodges tucked along the Hudson Bay coast. This is where polar bears amble and laze while waiting for sea waters to freeze once again—meaning they walk by and around these lodges! (The owners pioneered polar bear walking safaris in 1993.)

From Churchill, we took a small plane 38 miles to Seal River Heritage Lodge, admiring pods of belugas below, until our pilot said the magic words:  

> "There's a polar bear... oh, and there's another..."

We all got whiplash trying to catch glimpses of magnificent white beasts on grass and rock as the plane zipped past. He probably spotted about ten on the way.

Then, when we landed, a mom bear and two youngsters rounded the bend into the bush!  

> What a start! So many polar bears before we even checked in!  

Our armed guides carefully watched for any activity from the three bears near the landing strip before finally taking us to the lodge.  

This precautionary care/expertise is a fundamental principle for Churchill Wild, along with ethical wildlife viewing and sustainability. Our first on-site group event was all about safety, including bear deterrents and how to respond if a bear approached us (including looking "big" as a group). We had to stay about 330 feet away, but strategies were provided in case a bear came closer.

## Lodge Life and Activities

There were only 17 of us guests in this intimate lodge, immediately bonded by a love of nature and wildlife. Over the next five days, we enjoyed:  

- **Two daily hikes/walks** in soggy tundra, muck, or rocks, searching for bears or learning about the ecosystem.  
- **Three hearty, healthy meals** a day.  
- **Evening lectures**.  
- Continuous monitoring from the **watchtower**, either by staff or zealous guests like my daughter.  

Weather varied: we occasionally had T-shirt weather, but also stood in frigid rain one morning to admire a mom with two youngsters and a solo bear, all out on a spit. (The threesome were the same bears who greeted us upon arrival and saw us off when we left.)

### Beluga Day

One day was devoted to belugas. We took **Zodiacs** out on Hudson Bay where belugas swam all around us (and yes, a polar bear was swimming too!).

### Night Encounters

The days were long. Sometimes so were the nights:  

- Regan woke me up once for a bear right outside the lodge around 10:30 p.m.  
- And again at 11:20 p.m. (the same night!) for the Northern Lights. This was an unexpected bonus since nights were still pretty light near the Arctic.

### Departure

We were disappointed when we didn't see any polar bears for nearly a day and a half, partially due to the thick haze of smoke that was blown in from numerous wildfires in Manitoba. Then on departure day, there were **four** right at the lodge! The lodge manager practically had to drag us away to catch our flight—-we reluctantly left our bears, and a piece of our hearts, behind.

## Churchill Wild’s Blueberry Inn & Additional Excursions

Regan and I stayed in Churchill for three more nights at Churchill Wild's new, cozy Blueberry Inn, enjoying:  

- **Frontiers North's tundra buggy**  
  - One of only two operators allowed in the Churchill Wildlife Management Area (CWMA) and its polar bear hotspots.  
  - Guide Dylan McCart expertly managed rough roads and nearly 40 guests, serving lunch and drinks.  
  - We spotted **eight bears**, including three youngsters!

- **Sub-Arctic Tours**  
  - Private tour with owner Leroy Whitmore.  
  - He worked tirelessly to find us a polar bear in the publicly accessible areas around Churchill, making sure to point out arctic hares and belugas along the way. Near the end of the day, we spotted **one large bear**, sprawled atop rocks, and got to enjoy him for about an hour.

- **Discover Churchill's Northern Lights**  
  - It costs $25 per person to be on the call list for nights when the aurora is visible.  
  - We got the call around 10:30 p.m., drove out of town, and enjoyed a good light show, with an excellent photographer making sure to help capture the experience.

- **Sea North Kayaking**  
  - Out on the Churchill River, surrounded by hundreds of playful belugas.  
  - They are drawn to sound, so we sang show tunes—*"Hey, Big Spender"* was a hit!  
  - We were part of a group of over 40 kayakers; orientation took a while, but we got the full two hours in the water.

- **Car rental for bear spotting and general shenanigans**  
  - Limited public routes; we could not leave the vehicle.  
  - Spotted one bear on a spit and another galloping across the way!
  - We got to enjoy a beautiful sunset we would otherwise have missed.
  - Don't ask about the flat tire. Regan is starting to collect them in various countries through no fault of her own.

> **Final tally**: about **20 polar bears** over eight nights, including several cubs, two swimming, and two spotted on our own. By comparison, during a 12-day cruise around Svalbard, Norway, we saw only seven bears, all from very far away. Churchill rocks!

## Practical Notes

- **Travel**: Churchill is remote—you must fly from Winnipeg (expensive via Calm Air) or take an overnight train from Winnipeg via Thompson.  
- **Weather**: Pretty temperate in summer; Churchill Wild provides raincoats, wet pants, muck boots, and life jackets.  
- **Bugs**: Horrendous mosquitoes, biting horseflies, no-see-ums, etc. Face or full body nets recommended.  
- **Fireweed**: Around early August, you may see bears lying among vibrant purple fields at Seal River Heritage Lodge. Some operators offer limited tours to Hubbard Point, where multiple polar bears may be found among the flowers.

What a magical, unforgettable experience!
