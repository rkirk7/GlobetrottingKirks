Welcome to Mei-Mei's musings. This blog is part of my new [website](http://meimeikirk.com), a collection of previous and new insights and images on life, leadership, travel, media and anything else that piques my interest. I have two book ideas I'll work on with your help: one on branding yourself and one on my family's journey. I invite you to follow me, share your thoughts and help build my circle. Enjoy!
